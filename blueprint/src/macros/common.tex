% The theorem-like environments defined below are those that appear by default
% in the dependency graph. See the README of leanblueprint if you need help to
% customize this.
% The configuration below use the theorem counter for all those environments

% If you want for instance to number them within chapters then you can add
% [chapter] at the end of the next line.
