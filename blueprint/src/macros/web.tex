%â€¯In this file you should put macros to be used only by
% the web version. Of course they should have a corresponding
% version in macros/print.tex.
% Typically the printed version could have more fancy decorations.
% This will probably be a very short file.

% todos
\newcommand{\todo}[2][]{todo: #2} % text is shown in web version
% \newcommand{\todo}[2][]{} % text is hidden in web version
