\begin{definition}[splitter]
  \label{def:splitter}
  Let $\M$ be a class of binary matroids closed under isomorphism and under taking minors. Let $N$ be a $3$-connected minor of $\M$ on at least $6$ elements.
  If every $M \in \M$ with a proper $N$ minor has a $2$-separation, then $N$ is called a splitter of $\M$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[7.2.1.a splitter for nonwheels]
  \label{thm:7.2.1.a.splitter_nonwheel}
  \uses{def:splitter,def:wheel}
  Let $\M$ be a class of binary matroids closed under isomorphism and under taking minors. Let $N$ be a $3$-connected minor of $\M$ on at least $6$ elements.
  If $N$ is not a wheel, then $N$ is a splitter of $\M$ iff $\M$ does not contain a $3$-connected $1$-element extension of $N$.

\begin{theorem}[7.2.1.b splitter for wheels]
  \label{thm:7.2.1.b.splitter_wheel}
  \uses{def:splitter,def:wheel}
  Let $\M$ be a class of binary matroids closed under isomorphism and under taking minors. Let $N$ be a $3$-connected minor of $\M$ on at least $6$ elements.
  If $N$ is a wheel, then $N$ is a splitter of $\M$ iff $\M$ does not contain a $3$-connected $1$-element extension of $N$ and does not contain the next larger wheel.
