\section{2-Sum of Regular Matroids Is Regular}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:pivot_submatrix_det}
    Let $A$ be a $k \times k$ matrix. Let $r, c \in \{1, \dots, k\}$ be a row and column index, respectively, such that $a_{rc} \neq 0$. Let $A'$ denote the matrix obtained from $A$ by performing a real pivot on $a_{rc}$. Then there exists a $(k - 1) \times (k - 1)$ submatrix $A''$ of $A'$ with $|\det A''| = \frac{|\det A|}{|a_{rc}|}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Let $A''$ be the submatrix of $A'$ given by row index set $R = \{1, \dots, k\} \setminus \{r\}$ and column index set $C = \{1, \dots, k\} \setminus \{c\}$. By the explicit formula for pivoting in $A$ on $a_{rc}$, the entries of $A''$ are given by $a_{ij}'' = a_{ij} - \frac{a_{ic} a_{rj}}{a_{rc}}$. Using the linearity of the determinant, we can express $\det A''$ as
    \[
        \det A'' = \det A' - \sum_{k \in C} \frac{a_{rk}}{a_{rc}} \det B_{k}''
    \]
    where $B_{k}''$ is a matrix obtained from $A''$ by replacing column $a_{\cdot k}''$ with the pivot column $a_{\cdot c}$ without the pivot element $a_{rc}$.

    By the cofactor expansion in $A$ along row $r$, we have
    \[
        \det A = \sum_{k = 1}^{n} (-1)^{r + k} a_{rk} \det B_{r, k}
    \]
    where $B_{r, k}$ is obtained from $A$ by removing row $r$ and column $k$. By swapping the order of columns in $B_{r, k}$ to match the form of $B_{k}$, we get
    \[
        \det A = (-1)^{r + c} (a_{rc} \det A' - \sum_{k \in C} a_{rk} \det B_{k}'').
    \]

    By combining the above results, we get $|\det A''| = \frac{|\det A|}{|a_{rc}|}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:pivot_submatrix_det}
    Let $A$ be a $k \times k$ matrix with $\det A \notin \{0, \pm 1\}$. Let $r, c \in \{1, \dots, k\}$ be a row and column index, respectively, and suppose that $a_{rc} \in \{\pm 1\}$. Let $A'$ denote the matrix obtained from $A$ by performing a real pivot on $a_{rc}$. Then there exists a $(k - 1) \times (k - 1)$ submatrix $A''$ of $A'$ with $\det A'' \notin \{0, \pm 1\}$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
    Since $a_{rc} \in \{\pm 1\}$, by Lemma~\ref{lem:pivot_submatrix_det} there exists a $(k - 1) \times (k - 1)$ submatrix $A''$ with $|\det A| = |\det A''|$. Since $\det A \notin \{0, \pm 1\}$, we have $\det A'' \notin \{0, \pm 1\}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}\label{def:two_sum}
    Let $B_{1}, B_{2}$ be matrices with $\{0, \pm 1\}$ entries expressed as $B_{1} = \left[A_{1} / x\right]$ and $B_{2} = \left[y \mid A_{2}\right]$, where $x$ is a row vector, $y$ is a column vector, and $A_{1}, A_{2}$ are matrices of appropriate dimensions. Let $D$ be the outer product of $y$ and $x$. The $2$-sum of $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$ is defined as
    \[
        B_{1} \oplus_{2, x, y} B_{2} = \begin{bmatrix}
            A_{1} & 0 \\
            D & A_{2} \\
        \end{bmatrix}.
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{def:k_tu}
    Given $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$, we say that a matrix $A$ is $k$-TU if every square submatrix of $A$ of size $k$ has determinant in $\{0, \pm 1\}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    Note that a matrix is TU if and only if it is $k$-TU for every $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:two_sum_1_2_tu}
    Let $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$ be TU matrices and let $B = B_{1} \oplus_{2, x, y} B_{2}$. Then $B$ is $1$-TU and $2$-TU.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    To see that $B$ is $1$-TU, note that $B$ is a $\{0, \pm 1\}$ matrix by construction.

    To show that $B$ is $2$-TU, let $V$ be a $2 \times 2$ submatrix $V$ of $B$. If $V$ is a submatrix of $\left[A_{1} / D\right]$, $\left[D \mid A_{2}\right]$, $\left[A_{1} \mid 0\right]$, or $\left[0 / A_{2}\right]$, then $\det V \in \{0, \pm 1\}$, as all of those four matrices are TU. Otherwise $V$ shares exactly one row and one column index with both $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$. Let $i$ be the row shared by $V$ and $A_{1}$ and $j$ be the column shared by $V$ and $A_{2}$. Note that $V_{ij} = 0$. Thus, up to sign, $\det V$ equals the product of the entries on the diagonal not containing $V_{ij}$. Since both of those entries are in $\{0, \pm 1\}$, we have $\det V \in \{0, \pm 1\}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:two_sum_k_tu_induction}
    Let $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$. Suppose that for any TU matrices $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$ their $2$-sum $B = B_{1} \oplus_{2, x, y} B_{2}$ is $\ell$-TU for every $\ell < k$. Then for any TU matrices $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$ their $2$-sum $B = B_{1} \oplus_{2, x, y} B_{2}$ is also $k$-TU.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    For the sake of deriving a contradiction, suppose there exist TU matrices $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$ such that their $2$-sum $B = B_{1} \oplus_{2, x, y} B_{2}$ is not $k$-TU. Then $B$ contains a $k \times k$ submatrix $V$ with $\det V \notin \{0, \pm 1\}$.

    Note that $V$ cannot be a submatrix of $\left[A_{1} / D\right]$, $\left[D \mid A_{2}\right]$, $\left[A_{1} \mid 0\right]$, or $\left[0 / A_{2}\right]$, as all of those four matrices are TU. Thus, $V$ shares at least one row and one column index with $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ each.

    Consider the row of $V$ whose index appears in $A_{1}$. Note that it cannot consist of only $0$ entries, as otherwise $\det V = 0$. Thus there exists a $\pm 1$ entry shared by $V$ and $A_{1}$. Let $r$ and $c$ denote the row and column index of this entry, respectively.

    Perform a rational pivot in $B$ on the element $B_{rc}$. For every object, its modified counterpart after pivoting is denoted by the same symbol with an added tilde; for example, $\tilde{B}$ denotes the entire matrix after the pivot. Note that after pivoting the following statements hold:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\left[\tilde{A}_{1} / \tilde{D}\right]$ is TU, since TUness is preserved by pivoting.
        \item $\tilde{A}_{2} = A_{2}$, i.e., $A_{2}$ remains unchanged. This holds because of the $0$ block in $B$.
        \item $\tilde{D}$ consists of copies of $y$ scaled by factors in $\{0, \pm 1\}$. This can be verified via a case distinction and a simple calculation.
        \item $\left[\tilde{D} \mid \tilde{A}_{2}\right]$ is TU, since this matrix consists of $A_{2}$ and copies of $y$ scaled by factors $\{0, \pm 1\}$.
        \item $\tilde{D}$ can be represented as an outer product of a column vector $\tilde{y}$ and a row vector $\tilde{x}$, and we can define $\tilde{B}_{1} = \left[\tilde{A}_{1} / \tilde{x}\right]$ and $\tilde{B}_{2} = \left[\tilde{y} \mid \tilde{A}_{2}\right]$ similar to $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$, respectively. Note that $\tilde{B}_{1}$ and $\tilde{B}_{2}$ have the same size as $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$, respectively, are both TU, and satisfy $\tilde{B} = \tilde{B}_{1} \oplus_{2, \tilde{x}, \tilde{y}} \tilde{B}_{2}$.
        \item $\tilde{B}$ contains a square submatrix $\tilde{V}$ of size $k - 1$ with $\det \tilde{V} \notin \{0, \pm 1\}$. Indeed, by Corollary~\ref{cor:pivot_submatrix_det} from Lemma~\ref{lem:pivot_submatrix_det}, pivoting in $V$ on the element $B_{rc}$ results in a matrix containing a $(k - 1) \times (k - 1)$ submatrix $V''$ with $\det V'' \in \{0, \pm 1\}$. Since $V$ is a submatrix of $B$, the submatrix $V''$ corresponds to a submatrix $\tilde{V}$ of $\tilde{B}$ with the same property.
    \end{itemize}
    To sum up, after pivoting we obtain a matrix $\tilde{B}$ that represents a $2$-sum of TU matrices $\tilde{B}_{1}$ and $\tilde{B}_{2}$ and contains a square submatrix of size $k - 1$ with determinant not in $\{0, \pm 1\}$. This is a contradiction with $(k - 1)$-TUness of $\tilde{B}$, which proves the lemma.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:two_sum_tu}
    Let $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$ be TU matrices. Then $B_{1} \oplus_{2, x, y} B_{2}$ is also TU.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Proof by induction.

    Proposition for any $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$: For any TU matrices $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$, their $2$-sum $B = B_{1} \oplus_{2, x, y} B_{2}$ is $\ell$-TU for every $\ell \leq k$.

    Base: The Proposition holds for $k = 1$ and $k = 2$ by Lemma~\ref{lem:two_sum_1_2_tu}.

    Step: If the Proposition holds for some $k$, then it also holds for $k + 1$ by Lemma~\ref{lem:two_sum_k_tu_induction}.

    Conclusion: For any TU matrices $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$, their $2$-sum $B_{1} \oplus_{2, x, y} B_{2}$ is $k$-TU for every $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$. Thus, $B_{1} \oplus_{2, x, y} B_{2}$ is TU.
\end{proof}


\section{3-Sum of Regular Matroids Is Regular: Streamlined}

\begin{definition}\label{def:streamlined_three_sum}
    Let $B_{1} \in \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{(X_{1} \cup \{x_{2}, x_{3}\}) \times (Y_{1} \cup \{y_{3}\})}, B_{2} \in \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{(\{x_{1}\} \cup X_{2}) \times (\{y_{1}, y_{2}\} \cup Y_{2})}$ be matrices of the form
    \[
        B_{1} =
        \begin{NiceArray}{ccccc}[hvlines,right-margin=1em,left-margin=1em]
            \Block[draw]{4-4}{A_{1}} & & & & \Block[draw]{4-1}{0} \\
            \\
            \\
            & & \Block[draw]{1-1}{1} & \Block[draw]{1-1}{1} & \Block[draw]{1-1}{0} \\
            \Block[draw]{2-2}{D_{1}} & & \Block[draw]{2-2}{\overline{D}} & & \Block[draw]{1-1}{1} \\
             & & & & \Block[draw]{1-1}{1} \\
        \end{NiceArray}
        , \quad
        B_{2} =
        \begin{NiceArray}{cccccc}[hvlines,right-margin=1em,left-margin=1em]
            \Block[draw]{1-1}{1} & \Block[draw]{1-1}{1} & \Block[draw]{1-1}{0} \Block[draw]{1-4}{0} & & & \\
            \Block[draw]{2-2}{\overline{D}} & & \Block[draw]{1-1}{1} \Block[draw]{4-4}{A_{2}} \\
             & & \Block[draw]{1-1}{1} \\
            \Block[draw]{2-2}{D_{2}} \\
            \\
        \end{NiceArray},
    \]
    where $\overline{D}$ is a $2 \times 2$ matrix with $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ rank $2$ (i.e., $\overline{D}$ is non-singular over $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$). Note that $x_{1} \in X_{1}$, $x_{2}, x_{3} \in X_{2}$, $y_{1}, y_{2} \in Y_{1}$, $y_{3} \in Y_{2}$, $A_{1} \in \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{X_{1} \times Y_{1}}$, $A_{2} \in \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{X_{2} \times Y_{2}}$, $\overline{D} \in \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{(x_{2}, x_{3}) \times (y_{1}, y_{2})}$, $D_{1} \in \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\{x_{2}, x_{3}\} \times (Y_{1} \setminus \{y_{1}, y_{2}\})}$, $D_{2} \in \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{(X_{2} \setminus \{x_{2}, x_{3}\}) \times \{y_{1}, y_{2}\}}$. Then the $3$-sum of $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$ is defined as
    \[
        B_{1} \oplus_{3} B_{2} =
        \begin{NiceArray}{cccccccc}[hvlines,right-margin=1em,left-margin=1em]
            \Block[draw]{4-4}{A_{1}} & & & & \Block[draw]{4-4}{0} & & & \\
            \\
            \\
            & & \Block[draw]{1-1}{1} & \Block[draw]{1-1}{1} & \Block[draw]{1-1}{0} \\
            \Block[draw]{2-2}{D_{1}} & & \Block[draw]{2-2}{\overline{D}} & & \Block[draw]{1-1}{1} \Block[draw]{4-4}{A_{2}} \\
             & & & & \Block[draw]{1-1}{1} \\
            \Block[draw]{2-2}{D_{12}} & & \Block[draw]{2-2}{D_{2}} \\
            \\
        \end{NiceArray},
    \]
    where $D_{12} = D_{2} \cdot (\overline{D})^{-1} \cdot D_{1}$ and the indexing is preserved.

    To simplify notation, we write
    \[
        D_{1, 12} = [D_{1} / D_{12}], \quad
        D_{0, 2} = [\overline{D} / D_{2}], \quad
        D_{1, 0} = [D_{1} \mid \overline{D}], \quad
        D_{12, 2} = [D_{12} \mid D_{2}], \quad
        D = \begin{NiceArray}{cc}[hvlines]
            D_{1} & \overline{D} \\
            D_{12} & D_{2} \\
        \end{NiceArray}
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:streamlined_three_sum_B_2_signing}
    Suppose $B_{2}$ from Definition~\ref{def:streamlined_three_sum} has a TU signing. Then we can construct a TU signing $\tilde{B}_{2}$ of $B_{2}$ where all entries in columns $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$ are in $\{0, 1\}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Since $B_{2}$ is regular, it has a TU signing $B_{2}'$. Recall that multiplying rows and columns of a TU matrix by factors in $\{0, \pm 1\}$ preserves TUness.

    If $B_{2}'(x_{1}, y_{1}) = -1$, multiply column $y_{1}$ by $-1$. Similarly, if $B_{2}'(x_{1}, y_{2}) = -1$, multiply column $y_{2}$ by $-1$. Thus, we may assume that $B_{2}'$ has $B_{2}'(x_{1}, y_{1}) = B_{2}'(x_{1}, y_{2}) = 1$.

    Next, consider each row of $B_{2}'$. It can have one of the following forms.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $[0 \mid 0]$, $[0 \mid 1]$, $[1 \mid 0]$, $[1 \mid 1]$. In this case, we do not need to modify the signing.
        \item $[0 \mid -1]$, $[-1 \mid 0]$, $[-1 \mid -1]$. In this case, we can multiply this row by $-1$ to make all its entries non-negative.
        \item $[1 \mid -1]$, $[-1 \mid 1]$. This case leads to a contradiction, as the matrix composed of this row and row $x_{1}$ has
        \[
            \det \begin{bmatrix}
                1 & 1 \\
                1 & -1 \\
            \end{bmatrix} = -2
            \quad \text{ or } \quad
            \det \begin{bmatrix}
                1 & 1 \\
                -1 & 1 \\
            \end{bmatrix} = 2,
        \]
        which is impossible as $B_{2}'$ is a TU signing.
    \end{itemize}

    Thus, we can multiply columns and rows of $B_{2}'$ to obtain a TU signing $\tilde{B}_{2}$ where all entries in columns $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$ are in $\{0, 1\}$, as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:streamlined_three_sum_B_2_pivot_extra}
    Suppose $B_{2}$ from Definition~\ref{def:streamlined_three_sum} has a TU signing. Let $\tilde{B}_{2}$ be a TU signing of $B_{2}$ from Lemma~\ref{lem:streamlined_three_sum_B_2_signing}. To simplify notation, let $\tilde{a} = (\tilde{D}_{0, 2})_{\cdot y_{1}}$ and $\tilde{b} = (\tilde{D}_{0, 2})_{\cdot y_{2}}$. Then the following matrices are TU:
    \[
        \tilde{B}_{2}^{(a)} = \begin{NiceArray}{cccccc}[hvlines,right-margin=1em,left-margin=1em]
            \Block{4-1}{\tilde{a} - \tilde{b}} & \Block{4-1}{\tilde{a}} & \Block{4-4}{\tilde{A}_{2}} & & & \\
            \\
            \\
            \\
        \end{NiceArray}, \quad
        \tilde{B}_{2}^{(b)} = \begin{NiceArray}{cccccc}[hvlines,right-margin=1em,left-margin=1em]
            \Block{4-1}{\tilde{a} - \tilde{b}} & \Block{4-1}{\tilde{b}} & \Block{4-4}{\tilde{A}_{2}} & & & \\
            \\
            \\
            \\
        \end{NiceArray}.
    \]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Recall that pivoting in matrix $A$ on entry $a_{rc} \neq 0$ transforms the matrix as follows:
    \[
        \begin{NiceMatrix}[hvlines]
            a_{rc} & a_{rj} \\
            a_{ic} & a_{ij} \\
        \end{NiceMatrix}
        \quad \to \quad
        \begin{NiceMatrix}[hvlines,cell-space-limits=2pt]
            \frac{1}{a_{rc}} & \frac{a_{rj}}{a_{rc}} \\
            -\frac{a_{ic}}{a_{rc}} & a_{ij} - \frac{a_{rj} a_{ic}}{a_{rc}} \\
        \end{NiceMatrix}
    \]
    Pivoting in $\tilde{B}_{2}$ on $(x_{1}, y_{1})$ and $(x_{1}, y_{2})$ yields:
    \[
        \tilde{B}_{2} =
        \begin{NiceArray}{cccccc}[hvlines,right-margin=1em,left-margin=1em]
            \Block[draw]{1-1}{1} & \Block[draw]{1-1}{1} & \Block[draw]{1-4}{0} & & & \\

            \\
            \\
        \end{NiceArray}
    \]
    By removing row $x_{1}$ from the resulting matrices and then multiplying columns $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$ by $\{\pm 1\}$ factors, we obtain $\tilde{B}_{2}^{(a)}$ and $\tilde{B}_{2}^{(b)}$. Since $\tilde{B}_{2}$ is TU and TUness is preserved under pivoting, taking submatrices, and multiplying columns by ${\pm 1}$ factors, we conclude that $\tilde{B}_{2}^{(a)}$ and $\tilde{B}_{2}^{(b)}$ are TU.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:streamlined_three_sum_B_2_signing_exchanged}
    Suppose $B_{2}$ from Definition~\ref{def:streamlined_three_sum} has a TU signing. Then we can construct signings $\tilde{A}_{2}$, $\tilde{D}_{0, 2}$, and $\tilde{d}$ of $A_{2}$, $D_{0, 2}$, and $d = D_{\cdot y_{1}} + D_{\cdot y_{2}}$ respectively, such that $[\tilde{d} \mid \tilde{D}_{0, 2} \mid \tilde{A}_{2}]$ is TU.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Let $\tilde{B}_{2}$ be a TU signing of $B_{2}$ from Lemma~\ref{lem:streamlined_three_sum_B_2_signing}. Let $\tilde{D}_{0, 2}$ and $\tilde{A}_{2}$ denote the corresponding signings of $D_{0, 2}$ and $A_{2}$. Let $\tilde{d} = (\tilde{D}_{0, 2})_{\cdot y_{1}} - (\tilde{D}_{0, 2})_{\cdot y_{2}}$. Since $\tilde{D}_{0, 2} \in \{0, 1\}^{X_{2} \times \{y_{1}, y_{2}\}}$ by Lemma~\ref{lem:streamlined_three_sum_B_2_signing}, we have
    \[
        \tilde{d} = (\tilde{D}_{0, 2})_{\cdot y_{1}} - (\tilde{D}_{0, 2})_{\cdot y_{2}} = (D_{0, 2})_{\cdot y_{1}} - (D_{0, 2})_{\cdot y_{2}} = D_{\cdot y_{1}} - D_{\cdot y_{2}}.
    \]
    Thus, $\tilde{d} \in \{0, \pm 1\}^{X_{2}}$ and $\tilde{d}$ is a signing of $d$. Our goal is to prove that $\tilde{T} = [\tilde{d} \mid \tilde{D}_{0, 2} \mid \tilde{A}_{2}] \in \{0, \pm 1\}^{X_{2} \times (\{z, y_{1}, y_{2}\} \cup Y_{2})}$ is TU. To this end, let $V$ be a square submatrix of $\tilde{T}$. We will show that $\det V \in \{0, \pm 1\}$.

    Suppose that column (with index) $z$ (i.e., corresponding to $\tilde{d}$) is not in $V$. Then $V$ is a submatrix of $\tilde{B}_{2}$, which is TU. Thus, $\det V \in \{0, \pm 1\}$. Going forward we assume that column (with index) $z$ is in $V$.

    Suppose that columns (with indices) $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$ are both in $V$. Then $V$ contains columns (with indices) $z$, $y_{1}$, and $y_{2}$, which are linearly dependent by construction of $\tilde{d}$. Thus, $\det V = 0$. Going forward we assume that at most one of the columns (with indices) $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$ is in $V$.

    Suppose that column (with index) $y_{1}$ is in $V$. Then $V$ is a submatrix of $\tilde{B}_{2}^{(b)}$ from Corollary~\ref{lem:streamlined_three_sum_B_2_pivot_extra}, and thus $\det V \in \{0, \pm 1\}$. Otherwise, $V$ is a submatrix of $\tilde{B}_{2}^{(a)}$ from Corollary~\ref{lem:streamlined_three_sum_B_2_pivot_extra}, and so $\det V \in \{0, \pm 1\}$.

    Thus, every square submatrix $V$ of $\tilde{T}$ has $\det V \in \{0, \pm 1\}$, and hence $\tilde{T}$ is TU.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:three_sum_columns_of_d_D}
    Assume the notation of Definition~\ref{def:streamlined_three_sum} and let $d = D_{\cdot y_{1}} + D_{\cdot y_{2}} \in \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{X_{2}}$. Then the columns of $[d \mid D]$ are in $[d \mid D_{0, 2} \mid 0]$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Columns of $[d \mid D_{0, 2}]$ trivially satisfy the claim, so it only remains to show that columns of $D_{1, 12}$ are in $[d \mid D_{0, 2} \mid 0]$. Note that $D_{1, 12} = D_{0, 2} \cdot ((\overline{D})^{-1} \cdot D_{1})$, i.e., every column of $D_{1, 12}$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the columns of $D_{0, 2}$ (over $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$). In particular, every column of $D_{1, 12}$ is either zero, one of the columns of $D_{0, 2}$, or their sum. By construction, $(D_{0, 2})_{\cdot y_{1}} + (D_{0, 2})_{\cdot y_{2}} = d$. Thus, the desired result holds.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:streamlined_three_sum_d_D_A_2_signing}
    Suppose $B_{2}$ from Definition~\ref{def:streamlined_three_sum} has a TU signing. Then we can construct signings $\tilde{A}_{2}$, $\tilde{D}$, and $\tilde{d}$ of $A_{2}$, $D$, and $d = D_{\cdot y_{1}} + D_{\cdot y_{2}}$, respectively, such that $[\tilde{d} \mid \tilde{D} \mid \tilde{A}_{2}]$ is TU.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    By Lemma~\ref{lem:three_sum_columns_of_d_D}, columns of $[d \mid D]$ are in $[d \mid D_{0, 2} \mid 0]$. Thus, columns of $U = [d \mid D \mid A_{2}]$ are in $T = [d \mid D_{0, 2} \mid A_{2} \mid 0]$. Let $\tilde{A}_{2}$, $\tilde{D}_{0, 2}$, and $\tilde{d}$ be the signings from Lemma~\ref{lem:streamlined_three_sum_B_2_signing_exchanged}. Since adjoining zero columns does not affect TUness, $\tilde{T} = [\tilde{d} \mid \tilde{D}_{0, 2} \mid \tilde{A}_{2} \mid 0]$ is a TU signing of $T$.

    We construct signing $\tilde{U}$ of $U$ as follows. Let $i$ be a column index in $U$. Then $U_{\cdot i} = T_{\cdot j}$ for some column index $j$ in $T$, and we set $\tilde{U}_{\cdot i} = \tilde{T}_{\cdot j}$ with that $j$. By construction, $\tilde{U}$ consists of columns of $\tilde{T}$, so $\tilde{U}$ is a submatrix of $\tilde{T}$. Since $\tilde{T}$ is TU, $\tilde{U}$ is also TU.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
    Note that if a column of $[d \mid D \mid A_{2}]$ appears in $[d \mid D_{0, 2} \mid A_{2} \mid 0]$ multiple times, we may choose any of its occurrences when defining the signing.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:streamlined_three_sum_B_d_signing}
    Suppose $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$ from Definition~\ref{def:streamlined_three_sum} have TU signings. Then we can construct signings $\tilde{B}$ and $\tilde{d}$ of $B = B_{1} \oplus_{3} B_{2}$ and $d = D_{\cdot y_{1}} + D_{\cdot y_{2}}$, respectively, such that $[\tilde{d} \mid \tilde{D} \mid \tilde{A}_{2}]$ and $[\tilde{A}_{1} / \tilde{D}]$ are both TU.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Let $\tilde{A}_{2}$, $\tilde{D}$, and $\tilde{d}$ be signings from Lemma~\ref{lem:streamlined_three_sum_d_D_A_2_signing}. Let $\tilde{B}_{1}$ be a TU signing of $B_{1}$. Use the procedure from the proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:streamlined_three_sum_B_2_signing} to multiply some rows and columns of $\tilde{B}_{1}$ and $\tilde{T} = [\tilde{d} \mid \tilde{D} \mid \tilde{A}_{2}]$ by $\{\pm 1\}$ factors so that all entries in the submatrix $\{x_{2}, x_{3}\} \times (Y_{1} \cup \{y_{3}\})$ are non-negative in both $\tilde{B}_{1}$ and $\tilde{T}$. This procedure preserves the validity and TUness of both signings. Thus, by restricting $\tilde{B}_{1}$ we get a signing $\tilde{A}_{1}$ of $A_{1}$. By construction, $[\tilde{A}_{1} / \tilde{D}_{1, 0}]$ is a TU signing of $[A_{1} / D_{1, 0}]$.

    It remains to prove that $[\tilde{A}_{1} / \tilde{D}]$ is TU. Let $V$ be a square submatrix of $[\tilde{A}_{1} / \tilde{D}]$. Our goal is to show that $\det V \in \{0, \pm 1\}$.

    If $V$ is a submatrix of only $[\tilde{A}_{1} / \tilde{D}_{1, 0}]$ or $\tilde{D}$, then $\det V \in \{0, \pm 1\}$, as those matrices are TU. Going forward, assume that $V$ intersects $\tilde{A}_{1}$ and $\tilde{D}_{12, 2}$. \todo[inline]{finish}
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Repeats Definition~\ref{def:k_tu}]\label{def:streamlined_three_sum_k_tu}
    We say that a matrix $A$ is $k$-TU for $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$ if every square submatrix $T$ of $A$ of size $k$ has $\det T \in \{0, \pm 1\}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    Note that a matrix is TU if and only if it is $k$-TU for every $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:streamlined_three_sum_1_2_TU}
    Suppose $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$ from Definition~\ref{def:streamlined_three_sum} have TU signings. Let $\tilde{B}$ be a signing of $B = B_{1} \oplus_{3} B_{2}$ from Lemma~\ref{lem:streamlined_three_sum_B_d_signing}. Then $\tilde{B}$ is $1$-TU and $2$-TU.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    By construction,
    \[
        \tilde{B} = \begin{NiceArray}{cc}[hvlines,cell-space-limits=2pt]
            \tilde{A}_{1} & 0 \\
            \tilde{D} & \tilde{A}_{2} \\
        \end{NiceArray}
    \]
    where $[\tilde{A}_{1} / \tilde{D}]$, $[\tilde{D} \mid \tilde{A}_{2}]$, $\tilde{A}_{1}$, $\tilde{D}$, and $\tilde{A}_{2}$ are all TU (by Lemma~\ref{lem:streamlined_three_sum_B_d_signing} and as submatrices of TU matrices). In particular, all entries of $\tilde{B}$ are in $\{0, \pm 1\}$, so $\tilde{B}$ is $1$-TU.

    To show that $\tilde{B}$ is $2$-TU, let $V$ be a $2 \times 2$ submatrix of $\tilde{B}$. If $V$ is a submatrix of $[\tilde{A}_{1} / \tilde{D}]$, $[\tilde{D} \mid \tilde{A}_{2}]$, $[\tilde{A}_{1} \mid 0]$, or $[0 / \tilde{A}_{2}]$, then $\det V \in \{0, \pm 1\}$, as all of those four matrices are TU. Otherwise $V$ shares exactly one row and one column index with both $\tilde{A}_{1}$ and $\tilde{A}_{2}$. Let $i$ be the row shared by $V$ and $\tilde{A}_{1}$ and $j$ be the column shared by $V$ and $\tilde{A}_{2}$. Note that $V_{ij} = 0$. Thus, up to sign, $\det V$ equals the product of the entries on the diagonal not containing $V_{ij}$. Since both of those entries are in $\{0, \pm 1\}$, we have $\det V \in \{0, \pm 1\}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:streamlined_three_sum_k_TU_induction}
    Suppose $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$ from Definition~\ref{def:streamlined_three_sum} have TU signings. Let $\tilde{B}$ be a signing of $B = B_{1} \oplus_{3} B_{2}$ from Lemma~\ref{lem:streamlined_three_sum_B_d_signing}. Let $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$ and suppose $\tilde{B}$ is $\ell$-TU for every $\ell < k$. Then $\tilde{B}$ is also $k$-TU.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    For the sake of deriving a contradiction, suppose there exist $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$ such that $\tilde{B}$ is not $k$-TU. Then $\tilde{B}$ contains a $k \times k$ submatrix $V$ with $\det V \notin \{0, \pm 1\}$.

    Note that $V$ cannot be a submatrix of $\left[\tilde{A}_{1} / \tilde{D}\right]$, $\left[\tilde{D} \mid \tilde{A}_{2}\right]$, $\left[\tilde{A}_{1} \mid 0\right]$, or $\left[0 / \tilde{A}_{2}\right]$, as all of those four matrices are TU. Thus, $V$ shares at least one row and one column index with $\tilde{A}_{1}$ and $\tilde{A}_{2}$ each.

    Consider the row of $V$ whose index appears in $\tilde{A}_{1}$. Note that it cannot consist of only $0$ entries, as otherwise $\det V = 0$. Thus there exists a $\pm 1$ entry shared by $V$ and $\tilde{A}_{1}$. Let $r$ and $c$ denote the row and column index of this entry, respectively.

    Perform a pivot in $\tilde{B}$ on the element $\tilde{B}_{rc}$. For every object, its modified counterpart after pivoting is denoted by the same symbol with a hat; for example, $\hat{B}$ denotes the entire matrix after the pivot. Note that after pivoting the following statements hold:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\left[\hat{A}_{1} / \hat{D}\right]$ is TU, since TUness is preserved by pivoting.
        \item $\hat{A}_{2} = \tilde{A}_{2}$, i.e., $\tilde{A}_{2}$ remains unchanged. This holds because of the $0$ block in $\tilde{B}$.
        \item The columns of $\hat{D}$ are scaled (by $\{\pm 1\}$ factors) versions of columns of $[\tilde{d} \mid \tilde{D}]$. This can be verified via a direct calculation. \todo[inline]{need more details}
        \item $\left[\hat{D} \mid \hat{A}_{2}\right]$ is TU, since up to scaling (i.e., multiplying columns by $\{\pm 1\}$ factors) (and taking parallel columns) it is a submatrix of $[\tilde{d} \mid \tilde{D} \mid \tilde{A}_{2}]$.
        \item $\hat{B}$ is $(k - 1)$-TU. \todo[inline]{need to adjust assumptions of this lemma to be able to use $(k - 1)$-TUness here}
        \item $\hat{B}$ contains a square submatrix $\hat{V}$ of size $k - 1$ with $\det \hat{V} \notin \{0, \pm 1\}$. Indeed, by Corollary~\ref{cor:pivot_submatrix_det} from Lemma~\ref{lem:pivot_submatrix_det}, pivoting in $V$ on the element $\tilde{B}_{rc}$ results in a matrix containing a $(k - 1) \times (k - 1)$ submatrix $V'$ with $\det V' \in \{0, \pm 1\}$. Since $V$ is a submatrix of $\tilde{B}$, the submatrix $V'$ corresponds to a submatrix $\hat{V}$ of $\hat{B}$ with the same property.
    \end{itemize}
    To sum up, after pivoting we obtain a matrix $\hat{B}$ that is $(k - 1)$-TU, but contains a square submatrix of size $k - 1$ with determinant not in $\{0, \pm 1\}$. This contradiction proves the lemma.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:streamlined_three_sum_regular}
    Suppose $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$ from Definition~\ref{def:streamlined_three_sum} have TU signings. Let $\tilde{B}$ be a signing of $B = B_{1} \oplus_{3} B_{2}$ from Lemma~\ref{lem:streamlined_three_sum_B_d_signing}. Then $\tilde{B}$ is TU.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Proof by induction.

    Proposition for any $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$: For any matrices $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$ that have TU signings, the signing $\tilde{B}$ of $B = B_{1} \oplus_{3} B_{2}$ from Lemma~\ref{lem:streamlined_three_sum_B_d_signing} is $\ell$-TU for every $\ell \leq k$.

    Base: The Proposition holds for $k = 1$ and $k = 2$ by Lemma~\ref{lem:streamlined_three_sum_1_2_TU}.

    Step: If the Proposition holds for some $k$, then it also holds for $k + 1$ by Lemma~\ref{lem:streamlined_three_sum_k_TU_induction}.

    Conclusion: For any matrices $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$ that have TU signings, the signing $\tilde{B}$ of $B = B_{1} \oplus_{3} B_{2}$ from Lemma~\ref{lem:streamlined_three_sum_B_d_signing} is $k$-TU for every $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$. Thus, $\tilde{B}$ is TU.
