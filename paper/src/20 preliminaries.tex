\section{Preliminaries}

This section reviews Mathlib declarations our code relies on.

Throughout this paper, we write $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ to denote \texttt{ZMod n} for any positive integer $n$, most often in the case $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ denoting \texttt{ZMod 2}, which is also written as \texttt{Z2} in the code.
